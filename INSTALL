HOW TO INSTALL AND RUN THIS GAME

INSTALLATION:

SE-800 has only been successfully tested on Ubuntu 12.04.

Prerequisites:
cmake, cmake-gui
Google Protocol Buffers 2.5.0 full source (https://code.google.com/p/protobuf/downloads/list)
OpenScenGraph Debian Dependencies (http://trac.openscenegraph.org/projects/osg//wiki/Support/PlatformSpecifics/Debian-Dependencies)
OpenSceneGraph 3.2.1 rc2 full source (http://www.openscenegraph.org/downloads/developer_releases/OpenSceneGraph-3.2.1-rc2.zip)
OpenAL
freeALUT
OggVorbis (both the libogg and libvorbis libraries are required)
osgAudio (https://code.google.com/p/osgaudio/downloads/detail?name=osgAudio200.tar.gz)

Configure, build, and install all of the above prerequisites.
---
NOTE: osgAudio installation must be customized as follows:
-In the root directory of osgAudio, open CMakeLists.txt
-Set the 0_ENABLE_SUBSYSTEM_OPENAL option to ON and set the 0_ENABLE_SUBSYSTEM_FMOD
to OFF
-Set 0_BUILD_EXAMPLES_* to OFF (Examples use deprecated OpenSceneGraph classes and
thus do not compile.
-In the root directory of osgAudio, generate the Makefile by typing
cmake CMakeLists.txt
-Finally, build and install osgAudio with the generated Makefile
---

After having configured, built, and installed all of the above prerequisites,
you are now ready to build SE-800! Once in the SE-800 directory, the following
commands will build the game:

cd src
cmake CMakeLists.txt
make

----------------------------------

RUNNING THE GAME:

SE-800 can either run in server mode or in client mode.
The server processes the game state, physics engine, and AI engine.
The client renders game graphics and sends UI input.
A client cannot be started without a running server.

To run in server mode from the SE-800 directory:
cd src
./se800 server PORT

To run in client mode from the SE-800 directory:
cd src
./se800 client PORT IP_OF_SERVER

For example, to run a server and client on the same machine, one would
open two terminals in the SE-800 directory and run the following commands:

cd src
./se800 server 8000

cd src
./se800 client 8000 127.0.0.1
